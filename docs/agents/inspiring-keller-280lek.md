What: the process is in docs/AGENT_PROCESS.md; main (3e6cfa65 and later) is the common base. Start each session with
tools/remake/headless/session_setup.sh <work> all (about an hour) and the remake tests. I work on X/Y's trainers next:
new OrasXyTrainers.*, trainer and class limits in OrasEngine.cpp, a call in OrasXyWorld.cpp.
Needs: B and C, write your branch name and first plan in your own log; tell me before touching my area's files.
Commits: 3e6cfa65 (base).
