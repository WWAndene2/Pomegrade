# Omega Ruby's engine, decomposed

The atlas of the game's code and data, built from the code itself (Ghidra's decompilation and the emulator's GDB stub on the
running game), not from guesses: what each part does, the tables it reads, the limits it enforces and how to lift them. The
goal (owner, 7 October): a sandbox in which Sinnoh and a story are built on a blank map, nothing tied to Hoenn. Each fact is
marked **checked** (seen in memory or under the debugger), **read** (from the decompiled code) or **inferred**.
`ORAS_LITTLEROOT.md` keeps the history of the Littleroot and Route 201 work; this file keeps the engine.


## 0. Start here (the state on 7 October, for whoever continues)

**The owner's objectives, in order** (their words, 7 October): (1) take the game apart to the binary and learn every part;
(2) reference every table and asset; (3) a limitless sandbox; (4) remove the memory, cache, zone and asset limits; (5)
patch the game where it is in the way; (6) Sinnoh rebuilt on a blank map, nothing tied to Hoenn; (7) a story mod. Step
1-5 are under way here; 6 and 7 wait on them. The owner tests mods on their phone (Pomegrade, `ORAS_LITTLEROOT.md` 0).

**Where each stands**:

| Objective | State |
|---|---|
| 1 Decomposition | the whole code (`.code` + 145 modules, 47,602 functions) in one Ghidra program, checked against the game's own load; not yet: naming functions by what they do (record which run during each activity) |
| 2 Tables and assets | zones (section 2), map pieces (3), the boot memory map (4.2), the 299 archives tied to their code where opened by a constant (5); not yet: the 210 archives opened by computed numbers, the asset formats beyond `tools/remake/src`'s readers |
| 4 Limits | all 927 fatal checks listed, the field's and the `.code`'s classified (4.1, 4.3); lifted and checked headless: zones 536 -> 1024 (2), application memory 64 -> 124 MB (New 3DS mode) and the linear heap 43.3 -> 88 MB (4.4), the normal heap and heap 4 (heap 0xC 2 -> 8 MB, 4.4), characters 26 -> past 32 (4.5); refused at build time where it cannot be raised: a zone's events file under 0xC84 bytes (4.5); 178 MB is unusable (the system font: 4.4); not yet: the async load queue (8), collision objects per cell (4), texture slots per model (51), the 174-entry table (meaning unknown) |
| 5 Patches | `remake_tool oras-engine` writes them all (`exheader.bin`, `exefs/code.ips`); none run on the phone yet |
| 3, 6, 7 | not started on this basis: Sinnoh's region tools (`oras-region`, `ORAS_LITTLEROOT.md`) still borrow Hoenn's zones; next is building Sinnoh's zones from 538 up with the tools above |

**Setting up a session** (`tools/remake/headless/session_setup.sh <work dir>`): fetches the dumps from Drive into a work
folder outside the repository (ids in `POMEGRADE_ORAS_DRIVE_ID`, `POMEGRADE_PLATINUM_DRIVE_ID`, `POMEGRADE_SAVE_DRIVE_ID`:
the files of the owner's Drive folder "Pokemon Project - Radiant Platinum"; the Drive connector may not list recent
uploads, so ask the owner for share links), builds `remake_tool` and the code image, builds Azahar's libretro core with the
headless patches (about 30 min on 4 cores, once) and the Ghidra program (9 min, checked on a fresh folder: 47,557 functions
in one pass, against 47,602 when the modules were added to an analysed `.code`; DllField's piece handler decompiles as in
section 3). Then:

- **Run the game** (`tools/remake/headless/run_local.sh <work> <name> <mod|-> "<zone x z>" "<script>"`): 2 min to the field,
  6 for a walk; the owner's save stands in Littleroot (zone 6, tile 104.5, 170.5); move it with the zone and tile. A zone's
  characters are placed when the player **enters** it: to test them, start next door (zone 23, 100.5 150.5) and walk south.
  `shot NAME` saves the screen (the host's own "field up" detection is wrong under some mods: look at the picture).
  `report` lists every thread; one in the fatal-error loop shows pc 0x11EF50 / 0x11ABxx / 0x110Axx, `0011EF60` in its stack
  code addresses, and its registers and raw stack, from which the frames' saved registers give the object that failed.
- **Read code**: `analyzeHeadless <work>/ghidra_proj oras -process code.bin -noanalysis -readOnly -scriptPath
  tools/remake/ghidra -postScript Export.java <out> <address>...` decompiles the functions holding those addresses (a module's
  address is its linked one: `linked/modules.tsv` gives each base, DllField 0x10242000; in the running game DllField sits
  at 0x6F3000). `prototype/code_find.py <work>/dumps/code.bin --at|--imm|--word ...` finds an instruction or constant;
  `prototype/cro_dis.py <module.cro> dis <offset> <n>` reads a module with its imports resolved.
- **Read memory while it runs**: script commands `mem`, `watch` (a word's changes frame by frame, cheap and reliable),
  `dump` (raw memory for Ghidra). The GDB stub (`gdb 24689`, `run_local.sh ... gdb`) can stop on any instruction but is
  flaky in this host (section notes in `run_local.sh`): prefer `watch` and static reading when they suffice.

**How a limit is lifted, the way every one above was**: find the fatal call (the census, or the stack of a frozen run),
read its function, find where the bound and the matching allocation live (an immediate, a literal-pool word, a caller's
argument), predict what a patch changes, build a mod that crosses the limit **and an unpatched control** with the same
data, run both: the control must stop, the patched one must not, and a screenshot or a memory read must show the new
thing is really used. Add the words to `OrasEngine.cpp` (each with the game's own value: `CodePatchIps` refuses a word
that is not), a test where the code is new (`tests/remake/remake_codepatch_test.cpp`), and a subsection here. Pitfalls
met: a value can appear in the code for unrelated reasons (0x5ED000 is both heap 4's size and a data address: patching
both looped the game); an ARM immediate holds only an 8-bit value rotated by an even amount (pick sizes like 0x800000,
0x1800000); a continued save restores state from the save rather than from the files (the characters); a limit can hide
another (51 characters passed the count check and stopped on the events buffer).

## 1. How the engine is read

- **The dumps** (Drive folder "Pokemon Project - Radiant Platinum": the cartridge, Platinum, the owner's save `main.zip`) are
  fetched into the session's scratch space, never into the repository (`CLAUDE.md` §8).
- **Ghidra** (11.4.2, headless): `remake_tool oras-code` writes the ExeFS `.code` decompressed (5,439,488 bytes, loaded at
  0x100000); imported raw as `ARM:LE:32:v6` at 0x100000 and auto-analysed (256 s on 4 cores): **16,402 functions, 3.9 MB of
  code**. `ghidra/Export.java` lists them (entry, size, callers, callees) and decompiles given addresses:
  `analyzeHeadless <project> oras -process code.bin -noanalysis -scriptPath tools/remake/ghidra -postScript Export.java <out dir> <address>...`
- **The running game**: the headless core (`tools/remake/headless`) with the GDB stub; script command `gdb 24689`, then
  `gdb-multiarch` with `set architecture arm`, `set osabi none` (the stub's "3DS" OS type crashes gdb), `target remote :24689`.
  Breakpoints stop the emulated CPU; the core runs a scripted walk meanwhile.
- **All the code in one program**: `prototype/cro_link.py <out> static.crs <all .cro>` links the 145 modules at once from 0x10000000 (8.9 MB, to 0x108D9000), their imports resolved to the `.code` through `static.crs`'s absolute segments (code 0x100000, rodata 0x57A000, data 0x5EC000) and to each other; 0 unresolved. **Checked** against the game's own load of DllField (memory dump on the field, script command `dump`): every code word matches but the 340 that call other modules (placed elsewhere by design); 101 data words differ (written at run time). `ghidra/AddModules.java` adds the image to the `.code`'s program, names the exports and disassembles from them before auto-analysis.
- **The whole program analysed** (7 October, 417 s): the `.code` and the 145 linked modules, **47,602 functions** (18,373 in the `.code`, 4.05 MB; 29,229 in the modules, 3.87 MB). **Checked**: DllField's piece handler (offset 0x1E8CC, linked at 0x102608CC) decompiles with its calls into the `.code` resolved (the file count `< 7` test, the fatal call 0x11EF4C), as read by hand in `ORAS_LITTLEROOT.md` 0.
- **Code modules**: 145 CRO files in the RomFS (655 files in all), loaded above the `.code` (DllField at 0x6F3000 on the field);
  `prototype/cro_dis.py` reads one with its relocations and imports. They include Game Freak's debug modules `DllFieldDebug`,
  `DllDebugPokeMake` and `DllDebugProcLoop`: **checked**, empty in the retail game (8 KB each, 220 bytes of code, no text): no
  developer menu to switch back on.

## 2. Zones

- A zone is three records in `a/0/1/3`: its own member (0-535, a `ZO` container: header copy, events, scripts), a 56-byte
  entry in the **zone header table** (member 536, 30,016 bytes = 536 x 56) and an entry in the **encounter container**
  (member 537, `EN`, 536 files). **Read.**
- The header loader (`FUN_003d9740`): `if (zone > 0x217) fatal; header = table + zone * 0x38`, the table kept in memory whole;
  its other branch reads a zone file whose decompressed size must stay under a constant (`DAT_003d9884`). **Read; the
  `cmp r5, #536` at 0x3D9774 checked under the debugger** (zone 6 on the field).
- **The zone header table** is loaded once by `FUN_00112b50`: archive 13 (`a/0/1/3`) opened, **0x7540 bytes** (30,016 =
  536 x 56) allocated, member 536 read into it, **fatal unless the read size is exactly 0x7540** (the word at 0x112C0C); the
  pointer kept at 0x5F45BC, which the header loaders index with `zone * 0x38` (`DAT_003d9880` = 0x5F45BC). **Read.**
- **Two header loaders bound the zone number**: `FUN_003d9740` and `FUN_003d99b8`, `if (0x217 < zone) fatal`. Their other
  branch reads the zone's own member (`a/0/1/3` member = zone number) into a buffer of **0x4A58 bytes** (19,032; the word at
  0x3D9884): a zone file decompressed larger is fatal. **Read.**
- **536 (0x218) is also the "no zone" value**: lists of zones end with it (`FUN_004e4c08`), `FUN_003cbdec` returns it for an
  invalid id, and DllField initialises its zone fields to it (offsets 0x1B8EC, 0x35FE4, 0x9D998). Members 536 and 537 being the
  tables, a zone numbered 536 or 537 cannot exist; new zones are members **538 and up**, and the sentinel needs no change.
  **Read.**
- Not zone limits (other structures of size 0x218): 0x1D6C7C (an allocation), 0x31D60C (records of 0x218 bytes); 0x444964,
  0x444B84 not yet read.
- **Zone count raised, checked headless (7 October)**: `remake_tool oras-append-test <oras.3ds> <out> zone-raised` appends zone
  538 (a copy of zone 6 naming itself 538) over Littleroot's 16 blocks of matrix 1, grows member 536 to 539 rows and member 537
  to 539 files, and writes `exefs/code.ips` (`CodePatch.h`, each word checked against the game's own): the two bounds `cmp rN,
  #0x218` -> `#0x400` (zones below 1024) and the table size word 0x7540 -> 539 x 56. With the owner's save moved onto zone 538
  (`oras-save ... 538 100.5 172.5`): **without the code patch** (`zone`, the old a4) the game stops in the fatal-error loop
  (black screen); **with it** the field loads, the player walks, thread 1 idle. Under the debugger (breakpoint on the bound at 0x3D9774,
  gdb attached after boot) the header loader receives **zone 538**. So the 536-zone limit is lifted by data plus three code
  words. Not yet checked: the phone; save data kept per zone (flags, visited places); the region map; zones far
  above 538.
- **What raising the zone count takes** (derived first, now built as above): the table member 536 grown by 56 bytes a
  zone and the size word at 0x112C0C patched to match; the bound 0x217 in the two loaders raised (the immediate `cmp r5,
  #0x218` at 0x3D9774 and the one in `FUN_003d99b8`); the encounter container (member 537) grown with them (its reader not yet
  read); the new zones' members appended from 538. Other per-zone tables (flags, names, the region map) still to find.

## 3. Map pieces

- The piece slot table: 4 slots, filed under the word opening each piece's file 4 (`row | column << 8`); full table = fatal
  (`FUN_003c8a24`), a slot freed for the cell leaving the player's window (`0x3C8C84`). **Checked** (the Route 201 freeze,
  `ORAS_LITTLEROOT.md` 0).
- The piece buffer: 1 MiB (`0x100000`), checked in memory with piece 857.

## 4. The engine's hard limits: the fatal-error census

Every hard limit ends in the fatal-error routine (code 0x11EF3C, entered at 0x11EF4C by most callers: a loop calling the
handler at `[0x6173F0 + 0x6C]` forever, the freeze seen on the phone). `ghidra/FatalCensus.java` lists every call to it,
through the modules' import stubs too, with the decompiled lines before each call: **927 checks in 624 functions** (read).
By where they are: the `.code` 548 checks (382 functions), DllBattle 103, **DllField 96** (69 functions), DllSparring 54,
DllFieldEventSecretBaseMyBasePc 53, DllUSSecretBase 19, DllStatus 9, DllTownmap 7, the rest 1-5 each. Most compare against a
value loaded from a data word (the zone bound `0x217` is `DAT_003d9884`-style, not an instruction immediate), so each check is
classified by reading its function, not by its constant. Classified so far:

| Check | Where | Limit | How it was found |
|---|---|---|---|
| zone number > 0x217 | `FUN_003d9740` (0x3D9774) | 536 zones | read; checked under the debugger |
| piece slot table full | `FUN_003c8a24` | 4 pieces loaded | read; checked at the Route 201 freeze |
| piece file count < 7 | DllField 0x1E8CC (0x102608CC linked) | a piece is a `GR` of 7+ files | read |

### 4.1 DllField's 96 checks, classified (7 October)

Read from the decompiled functions (the 69 that hold a check, `ghidra/Export.java`), split in three and read in parallel by
sub-agents; their meanings marked **read** where the code shows them, **guess** otherwise. Spot-checked by hand: the 4 / 2 / 8
object counts of `FUN_102e0a4c` and the 320-byte bound of `FUN_102c0260` match the code. Offsets are DllField's (linked
address - 0x10242000). The ones that bound a larger region:

| DllField offset | Check | Limit | |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0x1E8CC | piece file count `< 7`, extra files in pairs, `(n-7)/2+1 < 5` | a piece: 7 files plus at most 3 extra pairs (4 animated parts, slots of 0x44 at +0xB4) | read |
| 0x9EA4C | counts at +0x84 `> 3`, +0x88 `> 1`, +0x8C `> 7` | 4 / 2 / 8 objects of three kinds per load (0x94, 0xA4, 0x24 bytes); the 4 matches the 2 x 2 piece window | read (the kinds: guess) |
| 0x84C98 | piece load direction not 0..7; window count asserted `== 4` | the streaming window is 4 pieces, 8 load directions | read |
| 0x271A8 | no free entry in the table at +0x8C (0xE4-byte entries, count at +0x90) | a runtime-sized object table, fatal when full | read (spawned objects or characters: guess) |
| 0x271A8 | id not found in the 0x50-byte records at +0x14 (16 sub-slots each) | requested ids must exist in that table | read |
| 0x42058 | id not in the two lookup tables (+0x3C, +0x38); 33 slots of 0xA0 (full: warning, slot 0 reused) | new models or objects must be added to those tables | read |
| 0x42CA8 | loads into 34 slots of 0xB8 | 34 loaded entries of some kind | read (kind: guess) |
| 0x2B628 | 13 objects of 0x40 and 165 of 0x4C; container files 8..172 read | a fixed-layout container of at least 173 files | read |
| 0x65228 | grid index outside width x height of the grid at +0xC4; direction byte not 0..3 | the field's grid bounds | read |
| 0x7E260 | a slot handler's size `> 0x13F` | 320-byte work buffer per slot (0x15C-byte slots at +0xD8) | read (script or event tasks: guess) |
| 0x993C8 | a value `> 0xFFF`, read with a 0x1000-byte request | 4 KB cap on some streamed data | read (what data: guess) |
| 0x87BD8 (`FUN_102c8bd8`) | container file count `!= byte count + 1` | N sub-files plus one shared file, the count stored apart | read |
| 0x73574 | 8 registry entries, all used | an 8-entry registry | read (content: unknown) |
| 0x15718, 0x3B2CC, 0xA0B50, 0xE05B0, 0xE16A8, 0x803D4 | scene registration (`FUN_0038b374`, `FUN_0038b69c`) failed | a scene capacity in the `.code`, not yet read | read (that it is a capacity: guess) |
| 0x27414, 0x29B14, 0x20B44, 0x2B3D8 | async load request refused (`FUN_0036ea84`, `FUN_0036d9dc`) | the loader's queue or heap, in the `.code`, not yet read | guess |
| many | resource binding failed (`FUN_003749f4`) | any malformed or oversized model or animation | read |

The others are invariants (idle state byte 0x14 before a new request, objects initialised twice, required globals present,
a character still stuck after a corrected move): rules on order, not capacities. Not in DllField: the zone bound (section 2),
the 4-slot piece table (section 3).

### 4.2 The memory map: every heap, created at boot by `FUN_00107c0c`

**Read, and the sizes held in data words read from the code** (7 October). `FUN_00145d44(0x8000000)` takes the application
memory, `0xE88000` of it goes to a system region (heap 1, `FUN_0010abd8`), the rest is split by `FUN_001120b4(parent, id, size)`
into sub-heaps. These sizes are the memory budgets: a larger world means larger heaps here (a patch to these words), within the
console's memory (ORAS asks the 3DS for its standard application memory; whether more can be had is not yet checked).

| Heap id | Size | | Heap id | Size |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 8 | 0x20000 (128 KB; event work buffers) | | 0x13 | 0xA800 |
| 9 | 0x392000 (3.6 MB) | | 0x14 | 0x14100 |
| 10 | 0x10000 | | 0x196 | 0x2900 |
| 0xB | 0x1400 | | 0x197 | 0x8000 |
| **0xC** | **0x200000 (2 MB; whole archive members loaded asynchronously, zones and areas)** | | 0x19 | 0x10000 |
| 0xD | 0x142420 (1.3 MB) | | 0x1A | 0x16D300 (1.4 MB) |
| 0xE | 0x3A000 | | 0xF8 | 0x80000 (512 KB) |
| 0xF | 0x115000 (1.1 MB) | | 0x18 | 0x1E000 |
| 0x10, 0x11 | 0x2000 each | | 0xF1 | 0x1B8000 (1.7 MB) |
| 0x12 | 0x4110 | | 0x1DD | 0x5000 |
| 0x112 / 0x113 | 0x3000 / 0x18000 | | **0x16** | **0x504000 (5 MB)** |
| 0x195 | 0x4000 | | **0x17** | **0x1C6D000 (28.4 MB, the largest)** |
| 0x1DE / 0x1DF | 0x3C00 / 0x10000 | | 0x1D9 / 0x1DA | 0x600 / 0x15C500 |

What lives in each heap is known only where a check names it (0xC: async member loads; 8: event work; 0xD, 0xF8: the
allocations in sections 4.3); the rest is to read.

### 4.3 The `.code`'s 548 checks, classified

Read in six parts by sub-agents from the decompiled functions, as DllField's; the memory map above checked by hand. Most are
invariants (singletons created or freed twice, null pointers, save-block magic checks, objects destroyed while loading). The
capacities that bound a larger world:

| Function | Check | Limit | |
|---|---|---|---|
| `FUN_003d9740`, `FUN_003d99b8`, `FUN_00112b50` | zone bound, zone file size, header table size | 536 zones, 0x4A58-byte zone files (section 2) | read; lifted (section 2) |
| `FUN_003c8a24` | no free slot | 4 map pieces loaded (section 3) | read, checked |
| `FUN_003f7ff4` | `0x1A < count` (zones 0x10, 0x30, 0x1C3 exempt), spawned `> 0x19` | **26 field entities per zone**, 0xAB0 bytes each | read (that they are characters: guess) |
| `FUN_003f54e8` | no free entry among the count at +0x36A0 | the field object pool (0xAB0-byte entries) | read |
| `FUN_003f2ed8` | `4 <` objects in a cell; 48-entry result buffer | 4 collision objects per cell | read (collision: guess) |
| `FUN_00471520` | pending count `>= 8` | async load queue of 8 | read |
| `FUN_004074c4`, `FUN_00404a5c`, `FUN_0049d830` and others | an async load could not start | whole members loaded into heap 0xC (2 MB) | read |
| `FUN_003d7dd0`, `FUN_0043abb0` | allocation returned null | the event heap and other heaps out of memory (section 4.2) | read |
| `FUN_0048883c` | `0x33 <` entries | 51 texture-slot entries per model (arrays inline in the model object) | read (textures: guess) |
| `FUN_00361604` | index `>=` capacity at +0x20 | model and animation slots of a resource set | read |
| `FUN_003623ec` | index `>=` capacity at +0x24 | resource slots, each an archive | read |
| `FUN_003cc4fc` and 7 others | `0xAD <` id | a table of 174 entries of 0x28 bytes (DAT_003cc530 ...) | read (what it holds: unknown) |
| `FUN_003fb230` | id over a range's max | 86 id ranges of 0x10 bytes (DAT_003fb388) | read (message or script ids: guess) |
| `FUN_003db6e4` | size `>=` DAT_003db770 | a multi-section event block copied into a fixed buffer | read (script data: guess) |
| `FUN_0010a4b0` (from the boot) | 0x20 | 32 code module slots | read |
| `FUN_00368600` and 10 others | module list `< 2` or `< 3` | each process loads 2-3 named CRO modules together | read |
| `FUN_004a0108` | `999 <` nodes | resource cache bucket walk | read |
| `FUN_00459018` and 5 others | `0x1E <` box, `0x1D <` slot, 0xE8 bytes | 31 x 30 Pokemon storage (PC boxes: guess from 232-byte records) | read |
| `FUN_004d343c` and others | `5 <` index | 6-entry arrays (party: guess) | read |
| `FUN_004ebde4` and others | magic checks, 0x2D1 | save blocks; 721 species bitfields | read |

### 4.4 The application memory, raised (checked headless, 7 October)

- **What the game gets** (**checked** in memory on the field): a linear heap of **0x2B48000 (43.3 MB)** at 0x14000000 and a
  normal heap of **0xDF0000 (14.3 MB)** at 0x08000000, plus the code (to 0x6AF000): the 3DS's standard 64 MB application
  mode, which the game declares in its extended header (`system_mode` 0, flags0 bits 4-7 of the ARM11 local caps at 0x20E).
- **Where it asks for them** (**read**): `FUN_00106448` at boot checks that 0x3938000 bytes are free, asks for the normal heap
  `mov r6, #0xDF0000` and the linear heap at the word **0x106508 = 0x2B48000** (`FUN_00107090`); `FUN_00107c0c` then makes
  heap 1 of the linear heap less 0xE88000, from which the sub-heaps of section 4.2 are carved. A larger linear heap grows
  heap 1 with it; the sub-heaps keep their sizes until patched.
- **A larger system mode alone changes nothing** (checked): with `exheader.bin` set to 96 MB (Azahar applies it: the game
  is reported "tainted") the game still takes 43.3 MB. **With the linear heap word raised too** (`code.ips`), it takes what
  it is given: 0x4748000 (71.3 MB, +28 MB, mapped 0x14000000-0x18748000 and read back in the game's own variable at
  0x61726C); the field loads and the player walks, thread 1 idle.
- **The parents** (**read**, `FUN_00107c0c`): heap 1 = the linear heap less 0xE88000 (it holds heap 0x17 only); **heap 4**
  (`[0x5F5014 + 0x18]`) = the top **0x5ED000** bytes of the normal heap (heaps 8, 0xB, 0xC, 0xD, 0xF8, 0x18, 0x10, 0x196 ...);
  heap 5 (`+0x1C`) = the last 0xE88000 bytes of the linear heap (9, 0xA, 0xF, 0x12, 0x14, 0x1A ...); heaps 0xE, 0xF1, 0x16 come
  from the system heap and 0x17 from heap 1. Heap 4's size is read by `FUN_00106448` (two `sub`s, 0x500000 + 0xED000) and from
  the word 0x108564; the same value in the words 0x110254 and 0x11AB74 is an address in the game's data, not this size
  (patching them sent the game reading 0xFFD000 in a loop: checked).
- **`remake_tool oras-engine <oras.3ds> <out> [--memory 64|72|80|96] [--linear-heap BYTES] [--normal-heap BYTES]
  [--zone-rows N] [--heap ID:BYTES]...`** (`OrasEngine.h`) writes every engine patch into the one `exheader.bin` and
  `exefs/code.ips` a mod carries, each word checked against the game's own; a heap whose size is an instruction's immediate
  takes only ARM-encodable sizes. **Checked headless (7 October)**:
  - `--memory 96 --linear-heap 0x4748000`: the same bytes as the run above;
  - `--heap 0x17:0x346D000` with it: heap 0x17 28.4 -> 52.4 MB, field and walk;
  - `--heap 0xC:0x800000` alone: **the boot stops in heap 0xC's creation**, heap 4 has no room;
  - `--memory 96 --linear-heap 0x4100000 --normal-heap 0x1800000 --heap 0xC:0x800000`: normal heap 14.3 -> 24 MB (mapped
    0x08000000-0x09800000), heap 4 6.2 -> 16 MB, **heap 0xC (async member loads) 2 -> 8 MB**, linear heap 65 MB: the field
    loads (screenshot, `shot` command) and the player walks, thread 1 idle.
- **The New 3DS mode, 124 MB** (`--memory 124`: the extended header's `n3ds_mode` 1 at 0x20D instead of the system mode;
  Azahar grants it with its New 3DS setting on, its default, on the phone too unless changed). **Checked headless**: with
  `--linear-heap 0x5800000 --normal-heap 0x1800000 --heap 0xC:0x800000 --heap 0x17:0x4000000` the game takes an 88 MB linear
  heap (read back at 0x61726C), a 24 MB normal heap, heap 0xC 8 MB and heap 0x17 64 MB (the game's 28.4), loads the field
  (screenshot) and walks. **178 MB (`n3ds_mode` 2) cannot be used**: the system's shared font is mapped at 0x14000000 plus its
  place after the application's memory, beyond the game's 128 MB linear window, and the game panics at boot
  (`svcBreak`, "cannot map APT:SharedFont") even with its own heaps unchanged (checked); the tool refuses it. In 124 MB the
  linear heap's ceiling is the total (code, normal heap and linear heap within 124 MB), which the tool checks.
  Not yet: the phone.

### 4.5 Characters per zone, raised past 26, bounded by the events buffer (checked headless, 7 October)

- **The limit** (**read**): `FUN_003f7ff4` places a zone's characters (its 0x30-byte records) when the player **enters** the
  zone; it stops the game when the zone lists more than 26 (`cmpne r6, #0x1A` at 0x3F8038; zones 0x10, 0x30 and 0x1C3 are
  exempt) and before a 27th appears (`cmp r0, #0x1A` at 0x3F808C, the count at +0x36AE). Each character takes an 0xAB0-byte
  entry of the field manager's pool, which `FUN_00112d4c` makes with the count its caller passes: **32** (`mov r3, #0x20` at
  0x109048), beside 32 inline records of 0x1B4 bytes in the manager. A continued save restores its characters from the save,
  not from the zone file: the check runs on entering a zone (checked: a crowded zone 6 resumed into does not stop).
- **`oras-engine --characters N`** (26 to 32) raises both bounds. **Checked**: zone 6 given 30 characters (`oras-append-test
  ... crowd`, clones of its own 11 on a grid; written with `OrasZone::Write`), the save on Route 101 (zone 23) north of it,
  walking south into Littleroot: **without the patch the game stops in the fatal-error loop; with `--characters 32` it enters,
  the clones stand in the town** (screenshot) and thread 1 is idle.
- **Above 32** (Platinum needs it: `platinum-zones` counts 28 headers listing more than 26 characters, 8 more than 32, at most
  51 in header 466): `--characters` up to 255 also grows the pool (`mov r3, #0x20` at 0x109048 -> the bound; the pool is
  allocated apart from the manager). With it, 51 clones still stop the game, elsewhere: `FUN_003db6e4`, called on entering
  a zone (DllField `FUN_102ddd8c`), copies the zone's **events file** (file 1: the arrays and the initialisation script) into
  a buffer of **0xC84 bytes** and stops when it does not fit (`DAT_003db770`); the buffer's size is also returned by a
  virtual getter (0x4605BC) of a save-data block, so it is part of the save's layout and is **not raised**. Zone 6's events
  file is 2,032 bytes, 1,268 of them its script: predicted and **checked** 35 clones (3,184 bytes) enter and show, 36
  (3,232 bytes) stop at the same place. So a zone's characters are bounded by that byte budget (each 0x30 bytes), not by 26:
  `OrasZone::Write` refuses an events file of 0xC84 bytes or more (`OrasZone::EventsBudget`), so a zone that would stop the
  game is refused when the mod is built. A Platinum map of 51 characters fits only with a short script, or by splitting
  its characters across zones.
- **`OrasZone::Write`** writes a zone back over its container (header, events, the rest kept): **checked identical on all 536
  zones** (`remake_tool oras-zone-check`).

## 5. The archives

The game opens its archives by number: the code holds a table of 299 pointers (0x5F5050) to their paths in UTF-16
(`rom:/a/0/0/0` ... `rom:/a/2/9/8`), and an archive's number is its path's digits, `a/X/Y/Z` = X*100 + Y*10 + Z (`a/0/1/3`, the
zones, is 13: the number the zone loaders pass). **Read.** `ghidra/ArchiveUsers.java` lists every call to the open function
(`FUN_0011c94c(obj, heap, number, flag)`) with its number: 215 calls, 174 with a constant number, which tie **89 of the 299
archives** to the code that reads them; the others are opened with a number computed from a table or a parameter (their
callers not yet read). The module that opens an archive gives its domain; what each archive holds is recorded only where a
reader in `tools/remake/src` or `ORAS_LITTLEROOT.md` shows it.
